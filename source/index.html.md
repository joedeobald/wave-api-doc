# Introductions

Welcome to the WAVE API! You can use our API to access WAVE API endpoints, which can get information.

We have language bindings in iOS and Android! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```swift
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: WAVEAPI"
```

```java
curl "api_endpoint_heresss"
  -H "Authorization: WAVEAPI"
```

> Make sure to replace `WAVEAPI` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: WAVEAPI`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>WAVEAPI</code> with your personal API key.
